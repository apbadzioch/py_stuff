# Python Practice Lab
Much like the JavaScript repo, this is a living repository to practice Python while exploring new libraries, tools, and concepts.
This repo serves as my experimental workspace -- a place to test ideas, learn by doing and deepen
my understanding of Python through hands-on implementation.

## Purpose
As I read documentation, explore new frameworks, or learn about unfamiliar libraries,
I implement small examples here to:
- Hopefully reinforce understanding through code
- Experiment without pressure
- Compare approaches and patterns
- Build around real-world usage
- Document what works (and what doesn't)<br/>

**This is not a polished repo, it's a learning environment.**

## Structure
- Unfortunately, not much. It kind of goes by what I read or learn about along the way.

## What You'll Find Here
The content evolves over time, but examples include:
- API requests and HTTP clients
- Async programming experiments
- Data handling (JSON, CSV, file I/O)
- Regex practice
- Library specific sandboxes (e.g., requests, pandas, fastapi, etc.)<br/>

**Each folder/file typically focuses on one concept at a time.**

## Philosophy
- Not everything is polished
- Not everything is optimized
- The goal is consistency and growth<br/>

**The code here reflects learning progress over time.**

## Topics Being Explored
- REST APIs
- AsyncIO
- FastAPI experiments
- Data analysis tools
- LLM tooling
- Automation scripts
- System-level scripting
- Debugging patterns

**As new tools emerge, they'll likely show up here.**
